We will make  rust fractal tool utility (cli)

We start with 2 executables 

ftk-julia
ftk-mandel

Example command:

ftk-mandel --bounds [-2.0,2.0,-2.0,2.0] --max-iterations 64 \ 
--dimensions [512,512] --spawn [0.0,0.0] --color-palette \
[(#FF0000,0.0),(#00FF00,0.5),(#0000FF,1.0)] \
--formula "z^2 + c" --bailout 4.0 --output "mandel_($DATE).png"


Note --spawn is normally mutated with julia sets but can be done
with mandelbrot sets too

All git commits: Nymessence <nymessence@gmail.com>

Test math first to ensure coerect complex math before compiling and
rendering. Also generate an html file alongside the png. Its 
purpose will be to allow the user to draw a box over the image
and then it will output an updated command to help a user frame a
render. 

git commit frequently.

Also there will be some radio buttons to snap the box on the html
for aspect ratios like 1:1, 3:2, 2:3, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9, and 9:16

This could be usefulfor anything from making website graphics to 
making art prints

web selector will also suggest various resultions as well then 
give the command to generate a new render

make sure to extensivley test and document everything.
